  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts by adopting the cleaner unified error handling from main branch, which eliminates code duplication while preserving the single random city selection feature from the feature branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "Combined the best of both branches: kept the random city selection feature from the feature branch (issue #205) and adopted main's cleaner unified error handling structure that avoids code duplication. For tests, chose main's more accurate plural comment 'city names' over singular 'city name'. Removed the conflicted pycache bytecode file as it was deleted on main branch."
