  "summary": "Resolved conflicts between feature/186 (single random city) and main (10 random cities). Preserved the feature branch's single-city behavior as this PR implements issue #186 which specifically requests picking 'a random city' (singular). Also resolved bytecode conflicts in __pycache__ files.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose feature branch (ours) for src/weather.py and tests/test_weather.py to preserve issue #186's requirement of selecting a single random city instead of main's 10-city feature. For __pycache__ files (auto-generated bytecode), chose ours version as these will be regenerated on next run anyway."
