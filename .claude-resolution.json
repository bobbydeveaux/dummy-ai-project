  "summary": "Resolved conflicts by preserving the feature branch's single random city selection behavior over main's 20-city implementation, consistent with PR #200's intent for issue #198. Removed conflicted bytecode cache file.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose feature branch (HEAD) implementation that selects a single random city when no city is specified, as this aligns with the PR's purpose (issue #198: 'update weather script to pick a single random city'). Updated corresponding tests to match the single-city behavior. Deleted the conflicted __pycache__ file to allow Python to regenerate it cleanly."
