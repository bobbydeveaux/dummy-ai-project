  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts by preserving the feature branch's behavior (1 random city) over main's behavior (5 random cities). The feature branch commit 'feat: update weather script to pick a single random city' explicitly indicates the intent to change from 5 cities to 1 city.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose HEAD (ours) for all conflicts - preserved the feature branch's single random city implementation in src/weather.py, updated corresponding tests in tests/test_weather.py to match the new behavior, and used the feature branch's compiled bytecode for src/__pycache__/weather.cpython-311.pyc. This maintains consistency between the implementation and tests while honoring the explicit feature being added in this PR."
