  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts by preserving the feature branch implementation that selects 10 random cities instead of 1. Updated both the main weather.py logic and corresponding tests to match the new feature.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose HEAD (feature branch) version for all conflicts. The feature branch (issue #207) implements an enhancement to select and display weather for 10 random cities when no city is specified, upgrading from the main branch's simpler 1-city selection. Preserved the complete implementation including the loop structure, city counter display, and updated test assertions to verify 10 cities are processed."
