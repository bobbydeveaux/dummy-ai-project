# dummy-ai-project

## Basic Project Information

**Project Name:** dummy-ai-project
**Purpose:** AI-powered development workflow demonstration
**Status:** Active Development

## What is this?

This project demonstrates how AI agents can automate software development tasks using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for task management and workflow orchestration.

## Quick Facts

- Built for demonstrating AI-assisted development patterns
- Uses Kubernetes CRDs for task lifecycle management
- Integrates with GitHub for pull request workflows
- Employs AI agents for automated code implementation

## Main Components

1. **CooTask CRD**: Custom Kubernetes resource for task definition and tracking
2. **AI Agents**: Automated workers that implement features and fix bugs
3. **GitHub Integration**: Automated PR creation and issue management
4. **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the development lifecycle

## Development Workflow

```
Issue Created → Task Assigned → AI Implementation → PR Created → Review → Merge
```

## Technology Stack

- Kubernetes (CRD framework)
- GitHub API
- Git automation
- AI agent orchestration system

## Getting Started

Tasks are managed as Kubernetes resources. The system automatically assigns tasks to appropriate AI agents who create implementation plans, write code, and submit pull requests for review.
