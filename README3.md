# dummy-ai-project

A demonstration project showcasing AI-powered development workflows and automated task management using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

## Overview

This project serves as a reference implementation for AI-assisted software development, featuring automated sprint management, task assignment, and pull request workflows orchestrated through Kubernetes CRDs.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Development**: Automated code generation and implementation by AI agents
- **CRD-Based Task Management**: Kubernetes-native task tracking and assignment
- **Automated Workflows**: Seamless integration between issue creation, implementation, and review
- **Sprint-Based Organization**: Structured development cycles with automated task distribution

## Technologies

- Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- GitHub API integration
- AI agent orchestration
- Git workflow automation

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates automated development workflows. Tasks are managed through Kubernetes CRDs and automatically assigned to AI agents for implementation.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with CRD support
- GitHub repository access
- kubectl CLI tool

### Usage

Tasks are created as CooTask CRDs and automatically processed by designated AI agents. Each task follows a structured workflow from assignment through implementation to review.

## Project Structure

This is a demonstration project designed to showcase AI-powered development patterns and automated task management workflows.

## Contributing

This project follows an automated development workflow where tasks are assigned to AI agents for implementation and human review.
