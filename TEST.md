# The Forgotten Symphony of Digital Waves

Beneath the surface of our interconnected world lies an invisible orchestra of electromagnetic signals, each carrying fragments of human communication across vast distances at the speed of light. These digital waves traverse fiber optic cables, bounce off satellites orbiting high above Earth, and ripple through the air as wireless transmissions, forming an intricate tapestry of information that binds our civilization together. From the simple text message to complex video streams, every byte of data rides these waves like notes in an ever-evolving symphony that never stops playing.
